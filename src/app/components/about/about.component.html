    <h2>What is Formula 1</h2>
    <p>
      Formula One (more commonly known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class
      of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars
      sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA
      Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing
      around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in
      the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must
      conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as
      Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents
      around the world on either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World
      Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors (the
      teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of
      racing licence issued by the FIA, and the races must be held on tracks
      graded "1", the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks.<br />
      Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the
      world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation
      of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is
      generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing
      severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce
      generated by the cars following directly behind, making it hard to
      overtake. Major changes made to the cars for the 2022 season has seen
      greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified wings to reduce the
      turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier. The
      cars are dependent on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension and tyres.
      Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other
      electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly
      reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and
      2008, respectively.

      With the average annual cost of running a team - designing, building, and
      maintaining cars, pay, transport - being approximately £220,000,000 (or
      $265,000,000), its financial and political battles are widely reported. On
      23 January 2017, Liberty Media completed its acquisition of the Formula
      One Group, from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for
      £6,600,000,000 (or $8,000,000,000).

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Formula One originated from the European Motor Racing Championships of the
      1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all
      participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon
      during 1946 with the first non-championship races taking place during that
      year. The first Formula One Grand Prix was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A
      number of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a motor
      racing world championship before World War II, but due to the suspension
      of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not
      become formalised until 1947.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The first world championship race took place at the Silverstone Circuit in
      the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa
      Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his
      teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio went on to win the championship in
      1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957. This set the record for the most World
      Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years
      until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.<br />
      Juan Manuel Fangio's 1951 title-winning Alfa Romeo 159 A Constructors'
      Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite being
      regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and
      1960s, never won the Formula One championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss
      finished second place in the championship four times and in third place
      the other three times. Fangio, achieved the record of winning 24 of the 52
      races he entered - a record for the highest percentage of Formula One
      races won by a single driver. This is a record he holds to this day.
      National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and
      1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held by promoters for many
      years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was
      held in 1983.
    </p>
    <p>
      This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as: Alfa
      Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured
      pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with narrow tyres
      and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The
      1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller,
      less powerful cars, due to concerns over the lack of Formula One cars
      available. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5
      litres was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz
      introduced their W196. The W196 featured things never seen on Formula One
      cars before, such as: desmodromic valves, fuel injection and enclosed
      streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next
      two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due
      to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.
